# Autonomous-Driving-via-RL
Applying RL algorithm methods for autonomous driving in Carla simulator

    Requirements
    1) Carla 0.9.6
    2) Install gym style wrapper from https://github.com/cjy1992/gym-carla

### DQN Agent built on Discrete Actions and primitive reward functions - DQN-Discrete-drive
Does okay on straight roads & slightly curve roads, breaks often (as to avoid collisions), follows lane,fails terribly on sharp turns & roundabouts.
